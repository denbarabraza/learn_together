# Learning Cards App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can create your own study cards in the app and share them with other students.
Study your cards and a friend's cards. After studying, evaluate your knowledge, and in case of a low score, the question
will be repeated again for a better study of the question.

You can decorate postcards with pictures.

Happy studying!
